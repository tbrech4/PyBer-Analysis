# PyBer-Analysis


### Analysis Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to view ridership data at PyBer - a fictional rideshare company similar to Uber or Lyft. The challenge focused specifically on fare & ridership data by City type. The three city types were Rural, Suburban, and Urban. 

### Results

Urban cities have the highest total number of rides, drivers, and total fares. However, average fare decreases as city size increases. This suggests that in a bigger city there are more drivers competing for business, leading to lower fares. Another possible explanation is that Urban rides are usually shorter, leading to a lower average fare. We would need trip length data to confirm this.

The chart shows some seasonal trends across all city types. Ridership seems to spike at the right before March.

Overall, total fares are always highest in Urban Cities, followed by Suburban and then Rural.

### Summary

I would suggest to the CEO that the firm does additional research to first see if going after additional rural ridership makes sense. 

This area lags behind, but that may be because there simply isn't much business to go after from rural areas. I.e most people prefer driving themselves or walking if possible. 

If rural ridership does prove to be worth going after, I would suggest they run marketing campaigns in rural areas with low ridership. When people think "Rideshare services" they likely think urban areas. I would try to change this and market to people that Rideshare services make sense in Rural areas too. 

Lastly, the suburban city type could be expanded. I would again run marketing in suburban areas in order to increase ridership.
